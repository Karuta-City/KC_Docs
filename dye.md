### Using the dye store (as a seller):
<br>
<b>During the buying process</b><br><br>
When you kv your dye the bot will automatically react both `ticket` and `check`:<br>
<img src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/846618628837212170/849998196784365588/unknown.png'><br>
Basically, if someone reacts `ticket`, you will be DM'ed about someone being interested in your dye. For example:<br>
```Seems like @Lax is interested in your dye ($nd7g \discord.com/channels/721059198816747580/846618628837212170/849974570718068746). If you didn't post the dye or posted it by mistake, please type g!report $nd7g [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!```<br>

This will only happen once, because once the first person reacts, when someone else reacts the bot will not DM you. (unless you reset it when the person isn't interested.)
Now, you should DM the person and ask if they are interested. If they are interested, Great! If they aren't, don't fret! Read on. I never posted that dye for sale? Don't worry, we got your back. Read on.<br><br>
<b>After the buying process</b><br><br>
Congrats! Your dye is now sold. Please go back to the post and react `check`. The post will be automatically deleted. Hurray!<br><br>

<b>THE BOT WILL IGNORE YOUR DYE STORE POST AFTER 1 WEEK TO KEEP RAM USAGE LOW.</b>

### Using the dye store (as a buyer):

When you see a dye you would like to buy, just react to `ticket`! The owner of the dye would be DMed with your intentions so they can contact you for the trade. Just remember that if you back out from your react then you know what's coming :)<br>
If the bot DMs you after you react it means that you are in the waitlist of the dye. The bot will dm you when you are the new buyer!

### Other rules you must follow in the store:

1. You must not post others' dyes in the store. If you do you will get <b>BANNED FROM THE ENTIRE SERVER</b>, as simple as that.
2. You must not troll react on other people's dyes. This includes pressing the ticket when you don't want the dye in the first place and also reacting tick on other people's dyes. If you do that by accident please DM an admin or mod. Second offence without contacting a mod will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.
3. You must not demand more than what you posted in the store. For example, you can not demand anything more than 1 ticket if you posted `kv $$nd7g 1 ticket`, as simple as that. 2 offences will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.
4. Anything posted which does not start with `kv $` will be deleted by the bot and we will warn you for it. 2 offences will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.

### FAQs
<b>The person isn't interested anymore. What the heck?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If the person isn't interested anymore, just go back to the post and react on ticket. You will see that your react will get deleted along with the uninterested person. The person wouldn't go unscathed though. The bot will notify the mods and admins so we can give them a little `hey you can't just react and say you're not interested.` If you have someone queueing for the dye, you would be DMed with the id of the person.<br><br>
<b>I didn't even post the dye. Why am I getting these DMs?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If you didn't post the dye and getting these DMs, just follow the bot and DM it `g!report [dye code] [a brief reason]`.<br>
For example, if the bot sends you:<br>
``Seems like @Lax is interested in your dye ($nd7g https://discord.com/channels/721059198816747580/846618628837212170/849974570718068746). If you didn't post the dye or posted it by mistake, please type g!report $nd7g [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!``<br>
DM the bot:
``g!report $nd7g I didn't post this dye but I am recieving the DMs. Can you check the logs for me?``<br>
<img src='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/846618628837212170/850004640836616203/unknown.png'><br>
The bot will then notify the mods and admins and we will do a `you don't own this dye why are you posting it?` :) <br><br>
<b>I can only see invalid-user as the buyer. What should I do?</b><br><br>
If you see invalid-user, check the message again on your PC. Android phones often show invalid-user.
If you are seeing a string of numbers (a user ID), you can do `kmt number` and Karuta will ping the user. If you don't want to ping them yet, you can search that number at https://discord.id/ and it will tell you the user.
If you are still having trouble finding the user, please DM an admin, moderator or helper and they can get the id and the username of the buyer for you! **DO NOT PRESS THE TICKET. YOU WILL REPORT THE USER WHICH WILL GET YOU WARNED.**<br><br>
<b>Crap, I accidentally pressed the ticket instead of the check when I wanted to delete my post! What should I do?</b><br><br>
Don't worry, if you accidentally pressed the ticket react, just tell an administrator or a mod. They won't warn you if you tell them. But if you do forget you will be warned in your second offence!<br><br>
