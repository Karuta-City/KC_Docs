Welcome to the Karuta City Maid Ticket Store Documentation! If for some reason you're lurking here but havent join us yet, [why not?](https://discord.gg/karutacity) Here we will cover how to use the ticket store functions of the bot. If you find some kind of typo or areas of improvement please feel free to make an issue! We will try and resolve it asap.

### Using the ticket store (as a seller):
<br>
<b>During the buying process</b><br><br>
When you kv your card (or if a mod/admin kvs for you) the bot will automatically react both `ticket` and `check`:<br>

Basically, if someone reacts `ticket`, you will be DM'ed about someone being interested in your card. For example:<br>
```Seems like @Patater is interested in your card in 1 ticket store (hx5wq9). If you think that is a mistake, please type g!report hx5wq9 [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!```<br>

This will only happen once, because once the first person reacts, when someone else reacts the bot will not DM you. (unless you reset it when the person isn't interested.)
Now, you should DM the person and ask if they are interested. If they are interested, Great! If they aren't, don't fret! Read on. I never posted that card for sale? Don't worry, we got your back. Read on.<br><br>
<b>After the buying process</b><br><br>
Congrats! Your card is now sold. Please go back to the post and react `check`. The post will be automatically deleted. Hurray!<br><br>

### Using the ticket store (as a buyer):

When you see a card you would like to buy, just react to `ticket`! The owner of the card would be DMed with your intentions so they can contact you for the trade. Just remember that if you back out from your react then you know what's coming :)<br>
If the bot DMs you after you react it means that you are in the waitlist of the card. The bot will dm you when you are the new buyer!

### Other rules you must follow in the stores:

1. You must not post others' cards in any of the stores. If you do you will get <b>BANNED FROM THE ENTIRE SERVER</b>, as simple as that.
2. You must not troll react on other people's cards. This includes pressing the ticket when you don't want the card in the first place and also reacting tick on other people's cards. If you do that by accident please DM an admin or mod. Second offence without contacting a mod will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.
3. You must not demand more tickets than where you posted you card in. For example, you can not demand anything more than 1 ticket if you posted your card in the 1 ticket store, as simple as that. 2 offences will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.
4. Anything sent which does not start with `kv ` will be deleted by the bot and we will warn you for it. 2 offences will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.
5. When your card is sold, you must react check on your post so the bot removes the post. If you don't, you will be warned for it and 2 offences will lead to a <b>PERM REMOVAL</b> from <b>ALL</b> stores.

### FAQs
<b>The person isn't interested anymore. What the heck?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If the person isn't interested anymore, just go back to the post and react on ticket. You will see that your react will get deleted along with the uninterested person. The person wouldn't go unscathed though. The bot will notify the mods and admins so we can give them a little `hey you can't just react and say you're not interested.` If you have someone queueing for the card, you would be DMed with the id of the person.<br><br>
<b>I didn't even post the card. Why am I getting these DMs?</b><br><br>
Don't worry. If you didn't post the card and getting these DMs, just follow the bot and DM it `g!report [card code] [a brief reason]`.<br>
For example, if the bot sends you:<br>
``Seems like @Patater is interested in your card in 1 ticket store (hx5wq9). If you think that is a mistake, please type g!report hx5wq9 [a short explaination] so the mods can deal with it! Thank you!``<br>
DM the bot:
``g!report hx5wq9 I didn't post this card but I am recieving the DMs. Can you check the logs for me?``<br>

The bot will then notify the mods and admins and we will do a `you don't own this card why are you posting it?` :) <br><br>
<b>I can only see invalid-user as the buyer. What should I do?</b><br><br>
I can only see invalid-user as the buyer. What should I do?</b><br><br>
If you see invalid-user, check the message again on your PC. Android phones often show invalid-user.
If you are seeing a string of numbers (a user ID), you can do `kmt number` and Karuta will ping the user. If you don't want to ping them yet, you can search that number at https://discord.id/ and it will tell you the user.
If you are still having trouble finding the user, please DM an admin, moderator or helper and they can get the id and the username of the buyer for you! **DO NOT PRESS THE TICKET. YOU WILL REPORT THE USER WHICH WILL GET YOU WARNED.**<br><br>
<b>Crap, I accidentally pressed the ticket! What should I do? (applies to both sellers and buyers)</b><br><br>
Don't worry, if you accidentally pressed the ticket react, just tell an administrator or a mod. They won't warn you if you tell them. But if you do forget twice your perms will be removed! (First offence warn, second offence remove perms)<br><br>
